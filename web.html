            <h1>Website Project</h1>
            <embed src="media/NerdCoding.gif"/>
            <p>This website was made by combination of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
              Thanks to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> website and their courses, we as a team have learned
              considerable amount of HTML and CSS markup languages to be able to develope this website and its pages.
            </p>
            <p>The fact that anyone can just create a website by a quick one week HTML course is fascinating and shows how long technology have come so far.
              Back in Sir Tim Berners-Lee's time, only select people were able to create a website, and they would barely have any designs.
              I can only imagine how relieved front-end developers would have been when HTML 5 have been launched and made their jobs so much easier.

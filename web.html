            <h1>Our Hour of Code Event</h1>
            <p>As a group of four IT students, we recently had the opportunity to organize an Hour of Code event at a state school. It was an exciting experience to be able to introduce the basics of coding and computer science to a group of young students.</p>
            <p>We started by using Code.org, which is a fantastic platform for beginners to practice coding exercises in a visual, interactive environment. The students were engaged and eager to learn as they used drag-and-drop blocks to create simple programs and see the results of their code in real-time.</p>
            <p>In addition to using Code.org, we also provided the students with some basic coding challenges to work on. These challenges were designed to help them develop their coding skills and see the practical applications of computer science. We encouraged them to create simple games, build calculators, and write programs to solve math problems.</p>
            <p>Throughout the Hour of Code event, we were impressed by the enthusiasm and eagerness of the students to learn. It was a great feeling to see them gain confidence in their coding abilities as they worked through the challenges and saw their programs come to life.</p>
            <p>Overall, it was a rewarding experience for our group to share our knowledge and passion for coding with the students. We hope that our Hour of Code event inspired the students to continue exploring the field of computer science and consider pursuing further study in the future.</p>
